# Test Project

In this test project, you will implement a simple event popup using the given GraphQL endpoint. The UI design is as follows:

![Event Popup UI](./design.png)

## Tasks

1. **Recreate the Popup UI**. Implement the popup UI based on the provided design. The background and other components are optional—only the popup itself is required.

2. **Display Event Details**. Use the `getTestEvent` query from the given GraphQL endpoint to fetch and display the following the test event's title, description, start and end times.

3. **Update Event on "Cancel"**. Add a "Cancel Event" button to the popup. When clicked, the button should update the event title to **"Canceled Test Event"** directly in the Apollo cache. No additional network requests should be made for this step, as the goal is to demonstrate a cache update.

## Additional Instructions

1. Please use the provided libraries to implement this project (i.e. React, Apollo GraphQL, Antd, the Popover component from @reactour), but feel free to include additional utility libraries if they make your implementation easier or more efficient.
2. Focus on implementing the popup UI as closely as possible to the provided design.
3. Submit the final deliverable as a GitHub repository link or a compressed file containing the project.
